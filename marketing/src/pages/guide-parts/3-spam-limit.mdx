## How does the Spam Limit option work?

The Spam Limit only affects Active Chatter giveaways. When doing the giveaway, every user will have how many times they entered counted. If this count exceeds the set spam limit, they will be removed from the draw before choosing winners. The goal of the spam limit is to reduce chat spam and catch bots spamming blindly.
