2. Unzip the folder
3. Run the **giveaway-o-tron.exe** file in the folder
4. It will show you the setup page, click on the link to direct to Twitch to get the required tokens
5. Copy and paste the tokens to the app, and hit the button
6. You should now see your chat!
7. Before doing giveaways or using on stream, you'll need to let it collect your initial followers and subscribers - it'll let you know how it's doing with messages in the bottom right of the app
8. Once you see a message saying two green ticks next to the progress bars at the bottom of your screen, you're good to go!
