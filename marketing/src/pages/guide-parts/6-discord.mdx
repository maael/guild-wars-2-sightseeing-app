## Discord Bot

### Inviting and Setup

At the top of the app, one of the buttons has the Discord icon, which will take you to the Discord Settings page.

In the top right of this page is a button which will take you to invite the bot to an available server.

Once the bot is invited, before it can post anything, it needs to know where you want it to send messages, and so you must enter the **Server ID** and **Channel ID**.

To get these:

1. In Discord, go to settings
2. Go to Appearance, Advanced, and enable Developer Mode
3. Right click on your Discord Server icon in the sidebar, and select Copy ID, and paste above
4. Do the same again but for a channel

### Configuration

Once the bot has been invited, and configured with the required IDs, it will post the default messages for winners and giveaways starting and ending.

You can control these on the Discord Settings page, by setting the Title and Body for each type independently. You can also enable/disable each message, by ticking or unticking the checkbox to the right of the other details.

You can use special keywords in the title and body messages to enter things like the winners name - for more details see in the app itself.

Mentions like **@role** will work in the message body as well and correctly notify Discord members with the specified role.

One useful setting you can also find on the Discord Settings page is **Giveaway Alert Min Time**. This interacts with the Timer tool on the main page. The **Giveaway Start** and **Giveaway End** messages will only be sent if the Timer duration exceeds the **Giveaway Alert Min Time**. This can be useful for only notifying your Discord for longer entry giveaways, and not the brief 2 minute flash entry giveaways.
