## Something isn't working

First off, open **Giveaway-o-tron**, and go to the Settings page by clicking on the cog icon.

At the bottom of the Settings page, there are two red buttons.

To begin with, click the **Sign Out Token Tool**. This will cause new Twitch tokens to be reissued, and available for you to copy.

Then, click on the **Reset Channel Info** button back in the app. This will take you back to the Setup screen, where you can enter the new tokens.

This should fix most issues.

If it does not, please let me know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/maael/giveaway-o-tron/issues/new) so it can be investigated.
