## OBS Alerts

At the top of the app, one of the buttons has the OBS icon, which will take you to the OBS Settings page.

Here you can copy your specific URL for the two available alert types, which are:

### **Winner Alert**

This alert will show the winners name in a brief alert. You can control how long the alert stays visible for with the **Duration** setting on the OBS Settings page.

### **Giveaway Status Alert**

This alert will automatically show giveaway status, based on the Chat Command entered on the main screen, and the status of the Timer tool also on the main screen.

When the Timer is started, the alert will change to display a message stating that the giveaway is open, as well as any chat command required (including descriptions of any special commands used).

When the Timer finishes, it will automatically update the alert to say that the giveaway has been closed.

Cancelling the Timer will remove the alert.
